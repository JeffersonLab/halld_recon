/// How this Event Source Works
/// ===================================================================
///
/// Overview
/// -------------------
/// This event source represents a complete rewrite of the original
/// JEventSource_EVIO class. It is highly optimized and while it
/// gets rid of some of the complexities that developed in the
/// original over time, in some ways it replaced them with complexities
/// of its own.
///
/// In a nut shell, this source launches a minimum of 2 dedicated 
/// threads for reading in and parsing the events. These are in
/// addition to any threads the JANA framework creates. There is
/// a single "dispatcher" thread that reads in the events and
/// assigns them to one of a group of "worker" threads.
///
/// JANA itself has a similar structure in that there is a single
/// "EventBufferThread" that grabs fully parsed events from this
/// class via its GetEvent method, and then hands them to one of 
/// a group of "processing" threads where the actual analysis begins.
///
/// One benefit of this design is that it allows certain objects,
/// methods, or member data to be modified by only a single thread
/// throughout its life. This avoids the use of locks which introduce
/// inefficiency in a multi-threaded application. 
///
///
/// BORconfig objects
/// --------------------
/// Typically, BOR events only occur at the begining of a file and
/// a given job will see only one. However, we must support the
/// possibility of multiple BOR events in case we are reading from 
/// an ET system or file of merged events.
///
/// BOR objects are applicable to all events in the stream until
/// another BOR event is encountered. We therefore need every event
/// to get a copy of the BOR config object pointers. Thus, they must be 
/// kept in a place that all worker threads see. This is the borptrs_list
/// object in the JEventSource_EVIOpp class.
///
/// Here's the sequence for how the BOR event is handled:
/// 1. When a BOR event is parsed it creates a DBORptrs object which
///    holds a complete set of BOR objects. The pointer to this 
///    DBORptrs object is left in the DParsedEvent object which
///    would otherwise be NULL. 
///
/// 2. When JEventSource_EVIOpp::GetEvent() is called, it will see the
///    non-NULL borptrs pointer in DParsedEvent. At this point it will
///    copy it to the front of borptrs_list, effectively giving ownership
///    to JEventSource_EVIOpp. Note that aside from the destructor,
///    borptrs_list is only accessed here which is only called from the
///    event reader thread. This means we don't have to use a lock.
///
/// 3. If the borptrs pointer is NULL, then JEventSource_EVIOpp::GetEvent
///    will copy the front pointer from borptrs_list into the
///    DParsedEvent. We rely on the events being in istream order here
///    to only apply the BORconfig objects to events after the BOR
///    event itself. 
///
/// 4. When GetObjects is called, it calls DParsedEvent::CopyToFactories
///    where the BOR objects are copied into the appropriate factories.
///    It then calls JEventSource_EVIOpp::LinkBORassociations to add
///    the BORConfig objects as associated objects to various hit objects.
///
/// 5. Only when the JEventSource_EVIOpp object is destroyed are any
///    BORConfig objects deleted. We don't implement a mechansim to
///    keep track of which DBORptrs objects are still in use so we can't
///    delete them sooner. This shouldn't be a problem though since BOR
///    events are rare.
