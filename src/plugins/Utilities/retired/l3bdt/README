This directory contains code to train a BDT
for use in the L3 trigger. A this point only
a single BDT is created. Eventually we may 
use multiple layers of BDT to improve efficiency.

The initial version of this is based on work
presented by Justin Stevens at the Oct. 4, 2013
collaboration meeting.

Here is a quick start guide to training a tree
and viewing the results:

> hd_root -o l3bdt.root -PPLUGINS=L3BDTtree -PNTHREADS=32 hd_rawdata_011667_135.evio
> root -l -b -q trainBDT.C
> ln -s $ROOTSYS/tmva/test/TMVAGui.C
> ln -s $ROOTSYS/tmva/test/tmvaglob.C
> root -l '$ROOTSYS/tmva/test/TMVAGui.C("l3BDT_out.root")'

The three most interesting things to look at are
probably buttons (4b) (5a), and (5b). The correlation
matrices (button (3)) are also interesting.
