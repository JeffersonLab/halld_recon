The script is used to calibrate ADC and TDC times for 
TAGH channels, for which the wrong RF bunch was selected.
The PSC time is used as an external reference for these
channels.

New calibration constants will be stored in the OUTPUT_SHIFT/run_number 
directory 

To publish fadc_time_offsets and tdc_time_offsets

`bash publish_time_shift.sh 90221 90221 90221`
